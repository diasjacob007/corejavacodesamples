CompletableFuture is used for asynchronous programming in Java. 
Asynchronous programming is a means of writing non-blocking code by running a task on a separate 
thread than the main application thread and notifying the main thread about its progress, completion 
or failure.

This way, your main thread does not block/wait for the completion of the task and it can execute other 
tasks in parallel.

CompletableFuture implements Future and CompletionStage interfaces and provides a huge set of convenient
methods for creating, chaining and combining multiple Futures. 
It also has a very comprehensive exception handling support.
